Extended Pre &amp; Post Processing Software for PERFROM-3D
The extension is an extended pre and post processing software for
PERFORM-3D mainly Version 7. The advantages of using this program shall be
summarized as follows:
1) Modeling Phase can help the users for faster modeling by editing information in
EXCEL, then converting information to be Binary files for importing to PERFROM-
3D.
2) Extraction Phase can help the users to extract several responses of the analysis
results in one time. In addition, the responses of multiple compound components
in a group are also able to be extracted.
3) Evaluation Phase can help the users to do faster combination of the responses
based on several ground motions and can help to evaluate the responses based on
demand over capacity ratios.
